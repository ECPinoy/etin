<h4> Open up Hamachi, do stuff to get it to work, and join my network (will give when I get back). Then you go and search up a moose picture (VERY IMPORTANT) and place it as your wallpaper. </br>
Once that's done, extract PPSSPP from the .zip folder, and place it in your desktop (or whereever you want it idc). Now start up PPSSPP and go click on Settings, then go to Networking.</br>
Check off Enable networking/WLAN (beta, might break games[not really]) and Enable built-in PRO ad hoc server.
