<h1> The Nazi Officer's Wife Summary (kindof) </h1>
</br>
</br>
At the start of the book Edith is working in the Red Cross and was tending to patients, then she sees a colleague get an onion to feed it to a Russian soldier. Luckily for that nurse, Edith was the only witness in that little exchange, and it's a good thing also because onions were super hard to get since Hitler was using them to gas the Jews in his concentration camps. This certain onion was bought off the black market, and that nurse would have been sent to a concentration camp to get a taste of her own medicine (get it? don't hurt me..). After a while, Edith's boss or something told Edith that she wasn't good enough to treat real patients after she had run out of an operation room. So Edith ended up in the maternity care area, and after a while she was moved again, but this time it was a scary switch. A mysterious man was sent in to the hospital-type-place, and he was hurt pretty badly. Why did the rest of the staff make Edith in charge of this man? Because he was high on the rankings for the Nazi army, of course! One slip-up, and she's dead. She turned out to be a great nurse and caretaker to this man, but one day she unknowingly recites a famous line, and the Nazi man recognized it. She acts dumb and flees from the scene. Edith then walked back to her husband in their apartment complex, where they attended a rally, with Edith representing the Red Cross. This rally was much more different, because it's evident that the Nazi powers were getting destroyed. Edith, known present-day as Giveret Beer, and her husband, Fred Beer, who was deceased when writing the book, told the story of how she survived World War 2 as a Jew. </br>
Edith had her parents and two sisters, living in Vienna. Edith attended school, and she loved it, unlike her sisters. Unfortunately, Leopold Hahn (the father) did not want to send Edith to school after primary school, because he did not belive in further education, but believed that Edith would follow in the footsteps of her mother. This changed, although, and Edith was able to go continue her studies. Klothilde Hahn (the mother) was great at, uh, being a woman. Hansi, the youngest in the immediate family, was the favorite of Edith, because there was a mutual disliking for her and her other sister, Mimi. Edith's father wanted to be a pure Jew, he loved the Jewish tradition very much. He just wanted his family to be pure Jew. Edith also had a close cousin, Jultchi, who's mother dropped her off at nine years old and killed herself. Jultchi's father still lives in Vienna, but apart from her grandparents, where she sayed.
