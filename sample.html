<h1> Halyosy - Connecting feat. Vocalist </h1> </br>
<p> Connecting is a Japanese Pop song written by halyosy, with the help of [TEST], mao, and 530 for music, Tama, or △○□×, and Bete, or べて, for visualizations, and Mes for english translations. Connecting has two versions, this one having multiple vocalists and the other having vocaloids (computer generated voices). The people featured are (in no specific order) Rib, Soraru, Lon, KK, Reol, Shakemi, and Otouto no Ane. For those who want to record themselves sing the song, or just want to use it in karaoke, halyosy provides a no lyric version of the song, so covers are supported! Connecting is a song about the narrator wanting to sing with the one who taught him/her to sing, because they had initially left. The narrator also says how the one who taught them also comforted them as they received criticism for their singing. Connecting is a very upbeat song with a nice mix of collaborators that make the song much more pleasing to listen to. The music video has a nice, colorful feel with nice effects that don't go overboard, and the illustrations were done really well also, with each singer having two illustrations of them, showing either an animated version of their actual image, or just a character they see themselves as. Overall, the song with the video show exactly how upbeat the whole project is. </p> </br>

NOTE: I know that I am pretty bad at this, but I want to try and get better, so it's alright if you reject me, but can you tell me what's wrong so I can make my writing better? Thank you!</br>
